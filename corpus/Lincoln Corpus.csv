DOC038,Temperance Address (Washington Society Speech),1842-02-22,Speech,Pre-Presidential,Moral persuasion; Reform; Democratic character; Rhetoric of reason over coercion,Reveals Lincoln's early theory of persuasion over compulsion — a precursor to his constitutional preference for consent-based governance,"When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted.","Collected Works Vol. 1, p. 271",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Temperance_Address
DOC055,Speech in Congress on the Mexican War (Spot Resolutions),1848-01-12,Speech,Pre-Presidential,War powers; Congressional authority; Executive overreach; Just war doctrine,"Lincoln challenges Polk's war-making authority — argues Congress alone can authorize offensive war, anticipating his own later war powers doctrine","The President, in his first war message of May 1846, declares that the soil was ours on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico; and whether this is true or false is the very point in dispute.","Collected Works Vol. 1, p. 431",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Speech_on_the_Mexican_War
DOC039,Eulogy on Henry Clay,1852-07-06,Speech,Pre-Presidential,Gradual emancipation; Colonization; Union preservation; Political moderation,Lincoln's clearest pre-presidential statement on slavery's constitutional status and his admiration for Clay's compromise tradition,"He loved his country partly because it was his own country, but mostly because it was a free country; and he burned with a zeal for its advancement, prosperity and glory.","Collected Works Vol. 2, p. 121",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eulogy_on_Henry_Clay_(Lincoln)
DOC056,Fragment on Slavery,1854-07-01,Fragment/Note,Pre-Presidential,Slavery; Natural rights; Moral philosophy; Constitutional contradiction,Private fragment where Lincoln works through the philosophical contradiction between slavery and natural rights — the intellectual foundation of his later constitutional arguments,"If A. can prove, however conclusively, that he may, of right, enslave B.—why may not B. snatch the same argument, and prove equally, that he may enslave A?","Collected Works Vol. 2, p. 222","https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fragment_on_Slavery_(July_1,_1854)"
DOC019,Speech on the Repeal of the Missouri Compromise (Peoria Speech),1854-10-16,Speech,Pre-Presidency,"Missouri Compromise, popular sovereignty, slavery extension, natural rights, Declaration of Independence, self-government","The Peoria Speech represents Lincoln's most comprehensive pre-presidential constitutional argument against the expansion of slavery, grounding his opposition in the Declaration of Independence's natural rights principles rather than purely constitutional text. Lincoln systematically dismantled the popular sovereignty doctrine of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, arguing that self-government cannot legitimately extend to the enslavement of others. The speech established the moral-constitutional framework Lincoln would develop throughout the 1850s, linking the founding documents into a unified antislavery constitutional vision.","No man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle—the sheet anchor of American republicanism.","Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 2, pp. 247-283",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Peoria_Speech

DOC058,Fragment on the Dred Scott Case,1857-05-18,Fragment/Note,Pre-Presidential,Judicial review; Dred Scott; Constitutional interpretation; Slavery jurisprudence,Lincoln's analysis of Taney's Dred Scott opinion — argues the Court cannot permanently settle political-constitutional questions against the will of the democratic majority,"We think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous.

I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free.","Collected Works Vol. 2, p. 461",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/House_Divided_Speech
DOC020,"First Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Ottawa, Illinois",1858-08-21,Debate,Pre-Presidency,"slavery extension, popular sovereignty, Declaration of Independence, Republican Party principles, racial equality, Kansas-Nebraska Act","In the Ottawa debate, Lincoln established the foundational constitutional positions he would defend throughout the series, affirming his opposition to slavery's extension while carefully distinguishing between federal power to abolish slavery in existing states versus territories. Lincoln invoked the Declaration of Independence as a constitutional interpretive lens, arguing that the founders' natural rights principles condemned slavery's spread even where they tolerated its temporary existence. His responses to Douglas's interrogatories reveal a sophisticated understanding of the limits of federal power and the constitutional status of slavery under the Fifth Amendment.",I believe the declaration that 'all men are created equal' is the great fundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest; that negro slavery is violative of that principle.,"Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 3, pp. 1-37",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lincoln-Douglas_Debates/First_Debate
DOC021,"Second Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Freeport, Illinois",1858-08-27,Debate,Pre-Presidency,"Freeport Doctrine, popular sovereignty, Dred Scott decision, territorial slavery, judicial supremacy, slavery containment","The Freeport debate is constitutionally significant for Lincoln's strategic interrogation of Douglas on the compatibility of popular sovereignty with the Dred Scott decision, producing the famous 'Freeport Doctrine.' Lincoln's question forced Douglas to articulate that territorial legislatures could effectively nullify a Supreme Court ruling through non-enforcement, exposing a fundamental tension between judicial supremacy and democratic self-governance. Lincoln also clarified his own constitutional position that while he was bound to respect Dred Scott as binding precedent, he reserved the right to work through political and legislative means to reverse it.","I wish to ask Senator Douglas whether a Territory can, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution.","Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 3, pp. 38-76",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lincoln-Douglas_Debates/Second_Debate
DOC022,"Third Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Jonesboro, Illinois",1858-09-15,Debate,Pre-Presidency,"slavery extension, Dred Scott decision, popular sovereignty, congressional power over territories, natural rights, racial hierarchy arguments","At Jonesboro, Lincoln deepened his constitutional critique of the Dred Scott decision and Douglas's popular sovereignty doctrine, arguing that the two positions were logically irreconcilable and that Douglas was engaged in deliberate obfuscation of the constitutional question. Lincoln articulated a theory of congressional plenary power over the territories rooted in Article IV, Section 3, directly challenging the Taney Court's holding that Congress lacked authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories. The debate also features Lincoln's careful constitutional distinction between civil rights, which he argued all persons possessed, and political and social rights, which he acknowledged were subject to democratic regulation.",I hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a new country without police regulations is historically false. It is not true at all. I hold that the history of this country shows that the institution of slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these 'police regulations' which the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual establishment of it.,"Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 3, pp. 102-144",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lincoln-Douglas_Debates/Third_Debate
DOC023,"Fourth Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Charleston, Illinois",1858-09-18,Debate,Pre-Presidency,"racial equality, social versus political rights, slavery containment, Declaration of Independence, constitutional limits of federal power, popular sovereignty critique","The Charleston debate is constitutionally notable for Lincoln's explicit statements distinguishing between natural rights equality under the Declaration of Independence and questions of social and political equality, reflecting the complex constitutional landscape of antebellum race law. Lincoln reaffirmed his core constitutional argument that the founders' antislavery principles, embedded in the Declaration and the Northwest Ordinance, established a trajectory toward slavery's ultimate extinction even while the Constitution temporarily accommodated its existence. The debate illuminates the tension Lincoln navigated between his moral opposition to slavery and his constitutional acknowledgment of its legal protections in states where it already existed.","I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races—that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people... there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.","Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 3, pp. 145-201",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lincoln-Douglas_Debates/Fourth_Debate
DOC024,"Fifth Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Galesburg, Illinois",1858-10-07,Debate,Pre-Presidency,"Declaration of Independence, natural rights, slavery as a moral wrong, Dred Scott critique, popular sovereignty inconsistency, constitutional founding principles","At Galesburg, Lincoln delivered some of his most forceful constitutional arguments linking the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution as a unified founding framework that condemned slavery's expansion. Lincoln challenged Douglas's reading of the founding era, marshaling historical evidence that the framers viewed slavery as a temporary evil to be placed on a path of ultimate extinction rather than a permanent constitutional institution. The debate features Lincoln's sustained argument that the Dred Scott decision represented a dangerous departure from the founders' constitutional design and that judicial decisions, while binding as precedent, remained subject to political reversal through constitutional processes.","He is blowing out the moral lights around us, when he contends that whoever wants slaves has a right to hold them; that he is penetrating, so far as lies in his power, the human soul, and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty, when he is in every possible way preparing the public mind, by his vast influence, for making the institution of slavery perpetual and national.","Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 3, pp. 207-244",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lincoln-Douglas_Debates/Fifth_Debate
DOC025,"Sixth Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Quincy, Illinois",1858-10-13,Debate,Pre-Presidency,"slavery as moral and political wrong, constitutional toleration versus endorsement of slavery, founding principles, slavery containment policy, popular sovereignty critique, national unity","The Quincy debate features Lincoln's clearest articulation of the constitutional distinction between tolerating slavery where it existed under the original constitutional compact and actively endorsing or expanding it as a positive good, a distinction he argued was fundamental to understanding the founders' intent. Lincoln elaborated his containment theory of constitutional antislavery policy, arguing that placing slavery on a course of ultimate extinction was consistent with the Constitution's text and the founders' expressed hopes, while Douglas's popular sovereignty doctrine would constitutionalize slavery's indefinite expansion. The debate also showcases Lincoln's argument that the Republican Party's position represented a return to the constitutional principles of the founding generation rather than a radical departure from them.","We have in this nation this element of domestic slavery. It is a matter of absolute certainty that it is a disturbing element. It is the opinion of all the great men who have expressed an opinion upon it, that it is a dangerous element. We keep up a controversy in regard to it. That controversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion, and if we can learn exactly—can reduce to the lowest elements—what that difference of opinion is, we perhaps shall be better prepared for discussing the different systems of policy that we would propose in regard to that disturbing element.","Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 3, pp. 245-289",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lincoln-Douglas_Debates/Sixth_Debate
DOC026,"Seventh Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Alton, Illinois",1858-10-15,Debate,Pre-Presidency,"slavery as moral wrong, Declaration of Independence, constitutional founding vision, slavery containment, popular sovereignty final critique, national destiny, right versus wrong framework","The Alton debate represents the culmination of Lincoln's constitutional argument across the entire series, synthesizing his moral-constitutional framework into its most refined form and establishing the philosophical foundation for his subsequent presidential constitutionalism. Lincoln's closing argument that the entire controversy reduced to a question of whether slavery was right or wrong, and that the Constitution must be interpreted in light of that moral reality, anticipated the constitutional vision of the Cooper Union Address and ultimately the Second Inaugural. The debate's constitutional significance lies in Lincoln's insistence that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution formed an integrated founding document whose antislavery implications could not be evaded by appeals to popular sovereignty or judicial precedent.",That is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between these two principles—right and wrong—throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings.,"Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 3, pp. 290-325",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lincoln-Douglas_Debates/Seventh_Debate
DOC002,Fragment on the Constitution and the Union,1860-01-01,Fragment/Note,Pre-Presidency,Union; Declaration of Independence; Natural rights; Liberty,Articulates Lincoln's view that the Declaration of Independence is the 'apple of gold' and the Constitution the 'picture of silver' framed around it — the Constitution exists to preserve the Declaration's principles,"The expression of that principle, in our Declaration of Independence, was most happy, and fortunate. Without this, as well as with it, we could have declared our independence of Great Britain; but without it, we could not, I think, have secured our free government, and consequent prosperity.","Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 4",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fragment_on_the_Constitution_and_the_Union
DOC017,Cooper Union Address,1860-02-27,Speech,Pre-Presidency,Slavery in territories; Founding Fathers' intent; Constitutional interpretation; Republican principles,Exhaustive historical argument that the Founding Fathers understood federal power to regulate slavery in territories; establishes Lincoln's originalist-style historical method,"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.","Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. 3",https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/address-at-cooper-institute/
