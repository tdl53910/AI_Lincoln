CP001,Union Perpetuity,Federalism & Sovereignty,The Union is older than the Constitution itself; it predates and supersedes any individual state's claim to sovereignty. Secession is legally impossible — no state can unilaterally leave the Union.,"First Inaugural Address (1861): 'No State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union'; Message to Congress July 4 1861: traces Union's origin to the Articles of Association (1774)",U.S. Constitution Art. IV §3; Preamble ('more perfect Union'); Supremacy Clause,"Akhil Reed Amar (Yale) argues Lincoln's Union theory was grounded in popular sovereignty — the people, not the states, created the Union. Directly opposed to Calhoun's compact theory.",State sovereignty movements; nullification; federal preemption disputes; tribal sovereignty
CP002,Declaration as Constitutional Lodestar,Constitutional Interpretation,The Declaration of Independence's equality principle is the moral foundation that gives the Constitution its purpose. The Constitution is the 'frame of silver' around the Declaration's 'apple of gold.',Fragment on the Constitution and the Union (c.1860); Gettysburg Address (1863); Cooper Union Address (1860),Declaration of Independence (1776); Constitution Preamble,"Lincoln explicitly rejected the Taney Court's reading of the Constitution as a pro-slavery document. He argued the Founders intended equality as a universal aspiration, not a present fact.",Equal protection interpretation; originalism vs. living constitutionalism; fundamental rights
CP003,Presidential War Powers & Military Necessity,Executive Power,"The Commander-in-Chief clause and the oath to 'preserve, protect and defend' the Constitution vest the President with extraordinary powers during rebellion or invasion — including measures not explicitly authorized by statute.",Message to Congress July 4 1861; Letter to Corning (1863); Emancipation Proclamation (1863); Letter to Hodges (1864),Art. II §2 (Commander-in-Chief); Art. II §1 (Presidential Oath); Art. I §9 (Habeas Corpus Clause),"John Yoo (Berkeley) and Michael Stokes Paulsen (St. Thomas) have used Lincoln's precedents to argue for expansive presidential war powers. Critics argue Lincoln's measures were emergency exceptions, not permanent expansions.",Emergency executive powers; war on terror; executive orders; national emergencies
CP004,Habeas Corpus & Civil Liberties in Wartime,Civil Liberties,"The writ of habeas corpus may be suspended during rebellion when public safety requires it. Lincoln argued the suspension power, though placed in Article I, could be exercised by the President when Congress was not in session — a contested position.",Order Suspending Habeas Corpus (April 27 1861); Message to Congress July 4 1861; Letter to Corning (1863),Art. I §9 Cl. 2 (Suspension Clause); 4th and 5th Amendments,"Chief Justice Taney (Ex Parte Merryman, 1861) held only Congress could suspend habeas corpus. Lincoln ignored the ruling. Congress ratified Lincoln's actions in the Habeas Corpus Act of 1863.",Detention without trial; enemy combatants; national security vs. civil liberties; FISA courts
CP005,Free Labor & Economic Liberty,Economic Rights,Labor is prior to and independent of capital. A free society must guarantee the right of every person to improve their condition through their own labor. Slavery is the antithesis of this principle.,First Annual Message to Congress (1861); Speeches on slavery 1854-1860; Fragment on Free Labor,13th Amendment (which Lincoln championed); Preamble ('general welfare'),"Lincoln's free labor ideology, rooted in Whig economics, anticipated later debates about economic rights and the relationship between political and economic freedom.",Labor rights; minimum wage; economic inequality; right to work
CP006,Constitutional Oath as Moral Imperative,Presidential Duty,"The presidential oath to 'preserve, protect and defend' the Constitution is not merely a formality — it is a binding moral and legal commitment that may require the President to take extraordinary measures to fulfill.","Letter to Hodges (1864): 'I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution, through the preservation of the nation'",Art. II §1 (Presidential Oath),Lincoln's oath argument is one of the most contested in constitutional theory. Some see it as a dangerous precedent for unchecked executive power; others as a necessary safety valve.,Presidential emergency powers; impeachment; executive accountability; rule of law
CP007,Majority Rule with Minority Rights,Democratic Theory,"A constitutional democracy requires both majority rule and the protection of minority rights. Neither side may use force to override the other — the remedy for disagreement is elections, not secession or revolution.","First Inaugural Address (1861): 'A majority, held in restraint by constitutional checks, and limitations, and always changing easily, with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people'",Art. IV §4 (Republican Form of Government Clause); 1st Amendment,"Lincoln's theory of democratic legitimacy directly confronts modern debates about electoral integrity, minority rights, and the limits of majoritarian democracy.",Electoral integrity; gerrymandering; minority voting rights; democratic backsliding
CP008,Reconstruction & Presidential Pardon Power,Separation of Powers,"The President's pardon power (Art. II §2) is broad enough to support a generous Reconstruction policy. The rebel states never legally left the Union, so the question is restoration of loyal governments, not readmission of new states.",Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction (1863); Last Public Address (1865),Art. II §2 (Pardon Power); Art. IV §4 (Guarantee Clause),Lincoln's Reconstruction theory clashed with Congress's Wade-Davis Bill (1864). His pocket veto and subsequent explanation are a key text on the separation of powers in reconstruction contexts.,Presidential pardons; post-conflict reconciliation; federalism in crisis; executive vs. legislative reconstruction
CP009,Constitutional Change Through Amendment,Constitutional Theory,"The proper mechanism for fundamental constitutional change is the amendment process (Art. V), not judicial interpretation or executive action alone. Lincoln championed the 13th Amendment as the permanent, constitutional solution to slavery.",Fourth Annual Message to Congress (1864); Lincoln's lobbying for the 13th Amendment,Art. V (Amendment Process); 13th Amendment,Lincoln's insistence on a constitutional amendment rather than relying solely on the Emancipation Proclamation reflects his understanding that executive orders are temporary and constitutionally fragile.,Constitutional amendments; judicial review vs. amendment; ERA; term limits
CP010,Equal Protection & Human Dignity,Equality & Rights,"All persons are created equal in their natural rights, even if positive law has not yet recognized this equality. The trajectory of the Constitution must be toward greater realization of the Declaration's equality principle.",Gettysburg Address (1863); Cooper Union Address (1860); Peoria Speech (1854); Last Public Address (1865),"Declaration of Independence; 14th Amendment (ratified 1868, post-Lincoln)",Lincoln's equality arguments laid the intellectual groundwork for the 14th Amendment. His 'new birth of freedom' framing is the origin of what scholars call the 'Second Founding.',Equal protection; affirmative action; civil rights; immigration; LGBTQ+ rights
CP011,Freeport Doctrine Challenge,Federalism & Sovereignty,"Lincoln forced Douglas at Freeport to reconcile popular sovereignty with Dred Scott, revealing that territorial legislatures could not lawfully exclude slavery if the Supreme Court held slavery a constitutionally protected property right. This exposed an irreconcilable tension between democratic self-governance at the territorial level and judicially enforced property rights under the Fifth Amendment.","Lincoln's Second Debate at Freeport (August 27, 1858): 'Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution?' Douglas's 'Freeport Doctrine' answer — that unfriendly legislation could nullify Dred Scott — Lincoln characterized as legally untenable and politically evasive.","Article IV, Section 3 (Territory Clause); Fifth Amendment (due process and property rights); Article VI Supremacy Clause — the tension between congressional and territorial power over property in territories","Harry V. Jaffa in 'Crisis of the House Divided' (1959) argues Lincoln's Freeport question was a deliberate constitutional trap demonstrating that popular sovereignty was logically hollow once Dred Scott was accepted as binding precedent, fatally undermining Douglas's national political coalition.","Preemption of state laws by federal constitutional rights, limits of local democratic majorities against judicially recognized property rights, tension between originalism and democratic federalism, Second Amendment preemption of local gun regulations"
CP012,Moral Neutrality as Constitutional Danger,Constitutional Interpretation,"Lincoln argued that Douglas's professed indifference to whether slavery was voted up or down represented not a neutral constitutional posture but an active moral corruption of republican self-government, because constitutional democracy presupposes that citizens deliberate about justice, not merely preference. A constitutional order that treats fundamental moral wrongs as mere policy choices erodes the normative foundation upon which constitutional authority itself rests.","Peoria Speech (October 16, 1854): 'I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world.' Fourth Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Charleston (September 18, 1858): Lincoln repeatedly challenged Douglas's 'care not' position as incompatible with the founders' expectation that slavery would eventually die out under moral pressure.",Preamble ('secure the Blessings of Liberty'); Article IV Section 4 (Republican Form of Government Clause); Ninth Amendment (unenumerated rights grounded in natural justice),"George Anastaplo in 'Abraham Lincoln: A Constitutional Biography' (1999) contends that Lincoln understood the Constitution as embedded in a moral tradition derived from the Declaration, making genuine constitutional interpretation impossible without reference to natural justice principles.","Judicial neutrality versus moral reasoning in constitutional adjudication, originalism versus natural law interpretation, constitutional limits on value-neutral legislation, First Amendment and content-neutral speech regulations"
CP013,Territorial Equality and Statehood,Federalism & Sovereignty,Lincoln argued at Peoria that the Kansas-Nebraska Act's allowance of discriminatory conditions for territorial governance violated the constitutional principle that all territories and their future states must be treated with equal dignity under federal law. Congress cannot constitutionally structure territorial admission processes in ways that entrench a particular social institution — especially one incompatible with republican government — as a precondition of statehood.,"Peoria Speech (October 16, 1854): Lincoln's extended critique of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise argued that allowing slavery's expansion into Kansas and Nebraska created a constitutionally unequal framework where some territories were burdened with a condition — slavery — that others were not, distorting the equal footing doctrine. Lincoln cited the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 as the proper constitutional model.","Article IV, Section 3 (Admissions and Territory Clause); Equal Footing Doctrine (judicially recognized from Pollard v. Hagan, 1845); Article IV Section 4 (Republican Form of Government Clause)","Akhil Reed Amar in 'America's Constitution: A Biography' (2005) argues the equal footing doctrine carries substantive constitutional weight, implying that Congress may not impose conditions on territorial admission that structurally disadvantage new states relative to existing ones or entrench anti-republican institutions.","Congressional conditions on state admission, PROMESA and Puerto Rico's territorial status, equal treatment of territories in federal benefits programs, statehood conditions for Washington D.C."
CP014,House Divided Constitutional Logic,Constitutional Interpretation,"Lincoln's 'House Divided' speech articulated a constitutional argument that a federal republic cannot indefinitely sustain two fundamentally incompatible legal regimes governing the same class of persons across its territory, because the Supremacy Clause and the logic of national citizenship require ultimate uniformity on questions of fundamental rights. The constitutional system would eventually resolve toward either universal freedom or universal slavery, making the conflict not merely political but structurally constitutional.","House Divided Speech, Springfield (June 16, 1858): 'A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free.' Lincoln grounded this not merely in prophecy but in constitutional logic — pointing to the Dred Scott decision's nationalizing tendency and Douglas's popular sovereignty as steps in a conspiracy to make slavery national.",Article VI Supremacy Clause; Article IV Section 1 (Full Faith and Credit Clause); Article IV Section 2 (Privileges and Immunities Clause); implicit national citizenship principles later codified in the Fourteenth Amendment,"Don E. Fehrenbacher in 'Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850s' (1962) argues Lincoln's House Divided logic was constitutionally sophisticated, anticipating that Dred Scott's property-rights reasoning, if extended through Full Faith and Credit, would effectively nationalize slavery and nullify free-state laws protecting Black residents.","Interstate recognition of same-sex marriage before Obergefell, Full Faith and Credit conflicts over abortion travel laws, national uniformity in Second Amendment regulations, federal preemption of conflicting state immigration regimes"
CP015,Equality as Constitutional Floor,Equal Protection,"Lincoln argued at Peoria that the Declaration of Independence's equality principle — 'all men are created equal' — functions as a pre-constitutional moral floor that no positive law, including the Constitution itself, can legitimately override, and that constitutional provisions must be interpreted in light of this foundational commitment. Legislation or judicial decisions that treat human beings as property contradict the normative foundation of constitutional authority and are therefore constitutionally defective even if textually permissible.","Peoria Speech (October 16, 1854): 'No man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle — the sheet anchor of American republicanism.' Lincoln explicitly invoked the Declaration as the interpretive key to the Constitution, arguing that the founders tolerated slavery only as a temporary necessity while placing it on a 'course of ultimate extinction.'",Declaration of Independence (equality principle as interpretive foundation); Preamble ('secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity'); Fifth Amendment (due process liberty); Ninth Amendment (unenumerated rights); principles later codified in the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause,"Pauline Maier in 'American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence' (1997) documents how Lincoln's Peoria argument elevated the Declaration from a political document to a constitutional interpretive text, a move that fundamentally reshaped how subsequent generations understood the relationship between natural rights and positive constitutional law.","Substantive due process and unenumerated rights, natural law foundations of equal protection doctrine, constitutional limits on majoritarian legislation targeting discrete minorities, international human rights norms as constitutional interpretive aids"
